# Interview Scheduler

This is a Front-End React application that allow users to book, edit or cancel an interview. Students can enter their names and select the interviewer of their choice. If no names were entered or no interviewers were selected, it will not go through. Should there be any errors occurred while trying to save or delete an interview, the application will advise so you can try again.

NOTE: This project was developed for learning purposes only through Lighthouse Lab Bootcamp.
